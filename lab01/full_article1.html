            One of the resolutions that many people often make at New Year's is: Losing weight and wanting to be healthier To the point of going out and buying a new set of clothes and shoes for exercising. In order to prepare for 'I'm going to start over' 'I'm going to get serious' 'I'm going to be thin this year, just wait and see'

And the brand that we often see people taking photos of those shoes on social media is Adidas. So why when going to exercise? People often think about and choose to buy clothes and shoes from this brand that is one of the top in the world.
